	<h2> Paragraph About me </h2> 
	<p>My name is Joel Franco. I am a student at Brookyn College. I am majoring in Computer Science. 
	<br> I am almost done with my Bachelor's Degree. I only need about 2 more semesters to graduate. 
	<br> I am most comfortable with Java, but I have done some assignments in C++ and I can learn C# and Javascript. 
	<br> My dream is to get a career in this field that not only pays decently, but is fun as well. I am working on a small game in Unity in my free time. </p>
